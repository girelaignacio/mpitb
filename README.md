# mpitb: a toolbox for estimating multidimensional poverty indices in R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this package is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the development version of mpitb from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("girelaignacio/mpitb")
```

This process may take time the first time.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how calculate the
Multidimensional Poverty Index:

#### Getting started

Load the `"swz_mics14"` dataset from the package. See the structure of
the variables.

``` r
library(mpitb)
## Use swz_mics14 data
head(swz_mics14)
#>   Household ID Household ID 2   Weight PSU Strata Water Assets School Nutrition
#> 1            1              1 1.137301   1      5     0      1      0         0
#> 2            1              1 1.137301   1      5     0      1      0         0
#> 3            1              1 1.137301   1      5     0      1      0         0
#> 4            1              1 1.137301   1      5     0      1      0         0
#> 5            1              2 1.137301   1      5     0      0      0         0
#> 6            1              2 1.137301   1      5     0      0      0         0
#>   Region  Area
#> 1 Hhohho Rural
#> 2 Hhohho Rural
#> 3 Hhohho Rural
#> 4 Hhohho Rural
#> 5 Hhohho Rural
#> 6 Hhohho Rural
```

We are going to estimate poverty disaggregated by different population
subgroups: Region and Area. Please note that if we see the structure of
this data, `Region` and `Area` are `Factor`.

``` r
str(swz_mics14)
#> 'data.frame':    20739 obs. of  11 variables:
#>  $ Household ID  : num  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
#>  $ Household ID 2: num  1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 ...
#>  $ Weight        : num  1.14 1.14 1.14 1.14 1.14 ...
#>  $ PSU           : num  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
#>  $ Strata        : num  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ...
#>  $ Water         : num  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ...
#>  $ Assets        : num  1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
#>  $ School        : num  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
#>  $ Nutrition     : num  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
#>  $ Region        : Factor w/ 4 levels "Hhohho","Manzini",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
#>  $ Area          : Factor w/ 2 levels "Urban","Rural": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
```

#### The first step

Specify the household survey design with `survey` R package and other
arguments to be used in the settings of our estimation of the MPI.

``` r
## Configurate the survey design 
data <- survey::svydesign(id=~PSU, weights = ~Weight , strata = ~Strata, data = swz_mics14)
class(data)
#> [1] "survey.design2" "survey.design"
```

#### The second step

Specify the set of parameters for our estimation of the MPI with
`mpitb.set` function. This function create a object of `mpitb_set` class
containing all the information that will be used in further functions
for calculating different AF measures.

Apart from our `data` object, parameters of `mpitb.set` function include
`indicators`, `cutoffs`, `weights` and other optional arguments: `over`
is the vector of the groups, `name` and `desc` are for specifying a
personal name and description of your setting.

``` r
indicators <- c("Water","Assets","School","Nutrition")
weights <- c(1/3,1/3,1/6,1/6)
cutoff <- c(25)
over <- c("Region","Area")
set <- mpitb.set(data, indicators, cutoff, weights, over, name = "SWZ2014 Example", desc = "This is an example taken from the OPHI Summer School 2022")
print(set)
#> --- Specification --- 
#>  Name:  SWZ2014 Example 
#>  Weighting scheme:  equal 
#>  Description:  This is an example taken from the OPHI Summer School 2022 
#> 
#> --- Survey design --- 
#> 20739 observations
#> Stratified 1 - level Cluster Sampling design (with replacement)
#> With (347) clusters.
#> mpitb.set(data, indicators, cutoff, weights, over, name = "SWZ2014 Example", 
#>     desc = "This is an example taken from the OPHI Summer School 2022")
#> 
#> --- Parameters ---
#>  Cut-offs:  1 ( 0.25 )
#>  Indicators:  4 
#> 
#> --- Number of subgroups ---
#> Region : 4 levels
#> 
#> 
#> Area : 2 levels
#> 
#> 
#> No missing values found
```

It is also possible to view a summery of our settings where further
information can be observed such as the uncensored headcount ratios of
the indicators.

``` r
#summary(set1)
```

#### Estimate the Adjusted Headcount Ratio, Incidence and Intensity of Poverty

``` r
#M0 <- mpitb.M0(set1)
#H <- mpitb.H(set1)
#A <- mpitb.A(set1)
```
