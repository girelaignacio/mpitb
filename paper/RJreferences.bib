    abstract = { In this article, I present mpitb, a toolbox for multidimensional poverty indices (MPIs). The package mpitb comprises several subcommands to facilitate specification, estimation, and analyses of MPIs and supports the popular Alkire– Foster framework to multidimensional poverty measurement. mpitb offers several benefits to researchers, analysts, and practitioners working on MPIs, including substantial time savings (for example, because of lower data management and programming requirements) while allowing for a more comprehensive analysis at the same time. Aside from various convenience functions, mpitb also provides low-level tools for advanced users and programmers. }
