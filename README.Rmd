The goal of mpitb is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of mpitb from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("girelaignacio/mpitb")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how calculate the Multidimensional Poverty Index:

```{r example}
#library(mpitb)
## Use swz_mics2013 data
#data <- swz_mics2013
## Configurate the survey design 
#data <- svydesign(id=~psu, weights = ~hhweight, strata = ~stratum, data = swz_mics213)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
